# Day 03 – Understanding the Relationship Between Cloud and DevOps

## Overview

Today focused on understanding how DevOps complements cloud infrastructure.

Cloud computing provides scalable infrastructure, while DevOps ensures reliable deployment, automation, and operational consistency within that infrastructure.

## Key Concepts Learned

### Infrastructure vs Operations

Cloud computing enables:

- Infrastructure provisioning
- Resource scalability
- Service availability

DevOps enables:

- Automated deployment
- System reliability
- Continuous integration and delivery
- Monitoring and feedback loops

These practices ensure infrastructure operates efficiently.

### Lifecycle Management

DevOps introduces structured lifecycle management, ensuring infrastructure is:

- Deployable
- Observable
- Maintainable
- Reproducible

This improves long-term system stability.

## Reflection

This clarified how DevOps strengthens cloud environments by introducing automation and operational discipline. Both fields work together to create scalable and reliable systems.
