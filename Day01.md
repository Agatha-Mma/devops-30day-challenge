# Day 01 – Environment Preparation and DevOps Foundation

## Overview

Today marked the beginning of my 30-day DevOps challenge. Coming from a cloud computing background, this phase focused on preparing my local environment to align with real-world DevOps workflows.

DevOps emphasizes consistency between development and production environments, and Linux plays a central role in most cloud and production systems.

## Actions Taken

- Installed Linux environment on my Windows system
- Installed and configured Git for version control
- Began reviewing DevOps foundational concepts and principles

## Key Concepts Learned

### DevOps as a Cultural and Operational Shift

DevOps is not just a collection of tools but a practice that emphasizes:

- Automation
- Collaboration between development and operations
- Continuous improvement
- Monitoring and feedback

This aligns closely with cloud computing, where infrastructure must remain scalable, observable, and reliable.

### Importance of Version Control

Git enables:

- Tracking changes over time
- Collaboration across teams
- Safe rollback in case of errors

Version control is foundational to DevOps workflows.

## Reflection

This setup phase reinforced the importance of environment readiness. Reliable infrastructure begins with consistent and properly configured environments.

This marks the first step toward strengthening operational and automation skills within cloud environments.
