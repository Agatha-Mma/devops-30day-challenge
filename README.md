# DevOps 30-Day Challenge

This repository documents my 30-day transition and deepening into DevOps engineering, building on my existing cloud computing foundation.

My goal is to strengthen practical skills in:

- Linux system operations
- Shell scripting and automation
- Version control with Git and GitHub
- DevOps workflows and best practices
- Environment consistency and reproducibility
- Cloud and DevOps integration

## Purpose

Coming from a cloud background, I created this challenge to focus on the operational side of infrastructure — automation, reliability, and deployment readiness.

This repository serves as a record of my hands-on learning, experiments, and progress throughout the challenge.

## Structure

Each day will include:

- What I learned
- Tools explored
- Key concepts understood
- Practical exercises (where applicable)

## Progress Log

- Day 1 – Environment setup (Linux, Git, foundation)
- Day 2 – WSL integration and development environment preparation
- Day 3 – Understanding the relationship between Cloud and DevOps
- Day 4 – Environment consistency concepts
- Day 5 – Automation fundamentals
- Day 6 – Observability and monitoring concepts
- Day 7 – Systems thinking in DevOps

(More updates will be added daily.)

## Objective

To become proficient in DevOps practices and contribute effectively to modern cloud infrastructure and deployment environments.
