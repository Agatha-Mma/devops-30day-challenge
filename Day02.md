# Day 02 – Development Environment Structuring with WSL and VS Code

## Overview

Today's focus was on improving my development environment by integrating Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with Visual Studio Code.

This creates a more realistic and production-aligned Linux environment locally.

## Actions Taken

- Installed and configured WSL
- Integrated WSL with Visual Studio Code
- Verified Linux terminal functionality within VS Code

## Key Concepts Learned

### Environment Parity

Production cloud environments typically run on Linux systems. Using WSL locally helps ensure consistency between:

- Local development
- Testing environments
- Production systems

This reduces deployment-related issues.

### Development Environment Integration

VS Code provides:

- Direct terminal access
- File system interaction
- Extension support
- Efficient workflow management

This improves productivity and operational efficiency.

## Reflection

This step bridges the gap between cloud infrastructure provisioning and operating within those systems. It strengthens my ability to interact directly with Linux-based environments, which is critical in DevOps workflows.
